# Len

Len is a privacy-first, local-first Windows desktop application for recording PHQ-9 and GAD-7 check-ins over time. It combines daily assessment responses with optional notes and treatment events, then creates a readable PDF conversation aid and a normalized XLSX Analysis Workbook.

Canonical repository: [github.com/DScannellWiz/len-mental-health](https://github.com/DScannellWiz/len-mental-health)

The project began as a personal response to the **Tyranny of Temporal Distance**: the difficulty of accurately describing weeks or months of symptoms during a short appointment when the most recent day can overshadow the broader pattern. See [Project Origins](PROJECT_ORIGINS.md) for the motivation and design history.

## Maturity and Availability

The frozen, pre-rename `0.3.0-alpha.1-redistribution.2` candidate is alpha/pre-release software for Windows 11 64-bit, not a finished or clinically validated product. It has passed 61 automated tests, fictional packaged workflow checks, and Daniel's hands-on development-workstation GUI walkthrough, but it has not received separate-machine validation. An older artifact received a limited separate-Windows receipt/extraction/launch/general-use check; that historical evidence does not apply to the `.2` candidate. This evidence does not guarantee that the software will work on every computer or be useful for every person.

No public binary download is available yet. The existing `PHQ9Tracker-Portable-0.3.0-alpha.1*` files and tag retain their historical Mental Health Tracker-era names and are not rebuilt or relabeled by this rename. Any future Len-branded binary must use a new version, pass exact-artifact validation, and be published only with separate authorization. Do not download executables or ZIP files from reposts or unofficial mirrors.

## Current Features

- Today's Check-In for PHQ-9, GAD-7, optional daily notes, and multiple treatment events.
- Previous Day and Next Day navigation, existing-date loading, future-date prevention, and unsaved-change protection.
- History / Manage Entries tools for editing and confirmed deletion of assessments, notes, and treatment events.
- Clearly labeled Daily Severity Scores and 14-Day Symptom Frequency Scores with recorded-day coverage.
- Review summaries, recent charts, treatment-cycle views, and long-term trends.
- Chart point values available by hover, click, and keyboard.
- A compact full-history PDF designed to support—not replace—a conversation with a licensed clinician.
- A normalized XLSX Analysis Workbook with assessment, item-response, note, treatment-event, cycle, metadata, daily-summary, and current 14-day item-profile records.
- One local `reports` folder for both generated outputs.

## Running from Source

Source use is intended for developers and requires Python 3.12 or later on Windows.

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
& ".\Launch Len.bat"
```

Run those commands from the project root. The launcher adds the repository's `src` folder to Python's import path and uses a project-local `.venv` or `venv` when available.

## Using a Portable Build

When an official portable ZIP becomes available:

1. Allow Windows Security or your antivirus product to scan the downloaded ZIP.
2. Extract the entire ZIP into a normal user-writable folder. Do not run the app from inside the ZIP.
3. Keep all extracted files together.
4. Start it with **Launch Portable Len.bat** whenever you want portable-mode storage.

Starting `PHQ9Tracker.exe` directly does not enable portable mode. A direct EXE launch uses the installed-mode data location under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PHQ9Tracker` instead of the extracted folder. Switching launch methods can therefore make an existing history appear missing even though it remains in the other location.

## Data, Reports, Backups, and Updates

The application does not include cloud synchronization or an automatic backup service.

| How the app is started | Database | Generated PDF/XLSX files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Official portable batch launcher | `phq9_tracker.sqlite` beside the launcher | `reports` beside the launcher |
| Packaged EXE started directly, or a future installed build | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PHQ9Tracker\phq9_tracker.sqlite` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PHQ9Tracker\reports` |
| Source launcher | `data\phq9_tracker.sqlite` in the repository | `reports` in the repository |

The SQLite database, PDFs, and workbooks can contain highly sensitive information and are not encrypted by the application. Store backups somewhere you control and protect them like other private health records.

Before replacing or updating the application:

1. Close Len.
2. Identify the storage mode you actually used from the table above.
3. Copy the database and any reports you want to retain to a separate backup location.
4. For a portable update, extract the new release into a new folder rather than overwriting the old folder. Copy the backed-up `phq9_tracker.sqlite` into the new extracted folder before launching it with the portable batch launcher.
5. Confirm that History shows the expected records before deleting the old folder or backup.

Current migrations are designed to preserve older PHQ-9 records, but backup and verification are still required. Reports are separate files; deleting records from the app or deleting the database does not automatically delete previously generated reports. In-app record deletion and manual database deletion are permanent without a backup. Deleting the database while the app is closed resets that storage location; the next launch creates a new blank database.

## Privacy and Support Boundary

This app is local-first. It does not intentionally upload assessment responses, notes, treatment events, databases, reports, or workbooks. Local-first design reduces exposure, but it is not a guarantee of privacy or security; the computer, backup location, email client, and any files the user chooses to share remain outside the application's control.

Never submit or email:

- a tracker database;
- a generated PDF, spreadsheet, export, or log containing entered data;
- assessment answers, scores, journal entries, treatment or clinician information;
- screenshots containing health information, names, account details, file paths that identify a person, or other private data.

For software support, provide the application version, Windows version, steps to reproduce the behavior, what you expected, what happened, and the exact non-health error or security-warning text. Screenshots are acceptable only after confirming that they contain no health information or other private data. Reproduce problems with newly created fictional data whenever possible.

The intentionally public project support address is `projectmentalhealthtracker@gmail.com`. It is for software and repository administration only. Do not send personal health information or generated health-data artifacts to that address. Support is best effort and is not continuously monitored.

See [Privacy and Data Handling](docs/PRIVACY_AND_DATA_HANDLING.md) and [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for the full boundaries.

## Windows Security Notice

The current candidate is not code-signed. Windows Defender, Microsoft SmartScreen, or another security product may scan it or warn that an unfamiliar pre-release application has limited reputation. Allow normal scanning. Do not disable antivirus protection, suppress an actual threat detection, or override a warning you do not understand.

If a warning appears, stop and report the exact product name, warning text, detected file, release filename, and release source without including private health data. Code signing would improve publisher identity and reputation signals, but it is not currently available and is not a substitute for clean build and release practices.

## Medical and Safety Disclaimer

Len is not medical advice, a diagnostic tool, a treatment recommendation, a medical device claim, an emergency service, or crisis support. It is not a substitute for a qualified healthcare professional. Scores, summaries, charts, and reports can be incomplete or misleading when data is missing and must be interpreted in context.

If you may be in immediate danger or need urgent help, contact local emergency services or an appropriate crisis resource. Do not use this repository, its issue tracker, or the project support email for emergency or clinical support.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project is developed with AI-assisted software engineering under the direction of the repository owner. Daniel defines the outcomes the product should achieve and remains the final reviewer for architecture, privacy, clinical framing, and release decisions. The assistant translates those outcomes into implementation, validation, and documentation work. This division of labor is an intentional development method and part of the project's provenance.
