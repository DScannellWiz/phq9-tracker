Real user data should stay out of GitHub. The repository keeps placeholder files so the intended folders are visible without committing private contents.

The `reports/` directory is the one active generated-output location for clinician PDFs and normalized Analysis Workbooks. The `exports/` directory remains ignored as legacy scaffolding, but the application no longer writes new workbooks there.
