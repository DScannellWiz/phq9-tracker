# Third-Party Notices

Mental Health Tracker is licensed under GNU GPL version 3. See the `LICENSE` file at the distribution root. The GPL does not replace the licenses and notices for third-party software included in the Windows package.

This directory preserves the upstream license, copyright, and notice text required for the exact `0.3.0-alpha.1` Windows redistribution build. The text files are copied verbatim from the installed distributions or their matching source distributions. `packaging/third_party_notice_manifest.json` records their SHA-256 hashes, and the release build fails if a required file, hash, runtime version, or package version differs.

The distributed CPython runtime contains OpenSSL 3.0.16 and SQLite 3.49.1. Their applicable license/acknowledgment text, including SQLite's public-domain statement, is preserved in CPython's complete incorporated-software appendix rather than paraphrased into a new license. The package also contains Microsoft UCRT 10.0.26100.4654 and VC runtime 14.42.34438 redistributable/system components.

Build-only packages such as `altgraph`, `packaging`, `pefile`, `pyinstaller-hooks-contrib`, `pywin32-ctypes`, and `setuptools` are pinned in `packaging/requirements-release.txt` for build reproducibility. They are not listed as distributed runtime components unless the final package inventory shows that their code is present.

These notices describe third-party terms; they are not legal advice and do not add restrictions to GNU GPL version 3.
